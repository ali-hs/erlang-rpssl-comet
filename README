Comet RPSSL
===========


RPSSL - Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard is a simple but famous game for 2
players. Ussualy it's played with your own hands, in first person, but this is 
the web version.

The web version uses the Comet technique (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29) 
which is a long running HTTP request that can be used for imidiate server push
of data to the client.

Each http request is a separate Erlang process. We can leave it to block
forever, holding the connection open, since it's using very little resources.


Mochiweb
========

Comet-RPSSL uses mochiweb as a http server. If you don't already have it
installed in the Erlang library path, you will need to download it and
compile it:

  mkdir lib ; cd lib
  svn checkout http://mochiweb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ mochiweb
  cd mochiweb
  make
  cd ../..

Now you can compile and run Comet-RPSSL:
 
  make
  erl -pa ebin/ -pa lib/mochiweb/ebin
  webserver:start([9999]).
